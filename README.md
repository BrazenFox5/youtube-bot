# youtube-bot
Unofficial YouTube bot.


https://github.com/BrazenFox5/youtube-bot/ - Incase you need to share this.
I got bored so I decided to want to make a bot.
2021/03/24, unfinished and no code at all yet. <<**YET**


Also, I will not share the Token as you can easily take it and go to LiveBot.exe and people will think I'm just a bad person trying to harrass people.
When I am done, to invite this bot, it is https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=824509999753199656&permissions=8&scope=bot, you have to be admin of a server to invite the bot.
